# Assignment #2 - Weather App

In this assignment, we are going to fetch weather data from a server and display:

- the following weeks weather

## How will this be marked?

#### I will not mark your assignment until the following is true:
- Can I visit a github repo?
- Can I visit a url to see the final result?

#### Requirements
In order to get 90%, I will be asking the following questions
- Is there a loading page?
- Does todays weather display correctly?
- Do all 6 days of the upcoming week display correctly?
- Are server errors handled gracefully?
- Are the correct icons being displayed based on weather type?

#### Over and Above
In order to get above 90%, you will need to do one of the following:
- Did you create your own design?
- Does something other than text and icons change in response to the weather type? Examples:
    - colors
